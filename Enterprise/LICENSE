MariaDB MaxScale Enterprise License Terms

These MariaDB MaxScale Enterprise License Terms (“Terms”) apply to Customer’s use of the MariaDB
MaxScale Enterprise software product (“MaxScale”) and its associated Documentation. “Documentation”
means written technical information pertaining to MaxScale and made available by MariaDB USA, Inc. or its
affiliate (“MariaDB”). By using MaxScale, Customer agrees to these Terms. These Terms are in addition to, and
supplement, the terms of the subscription agreement separately entered into between Customer and MariaDB
(the “Subscription Agreement”). Except as set forth herein, capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth
in the Subscription Agreement. MaxScale is “Software” as separately defined in the Subscription Agreement.

1. License Grant. Subject to Customer’s payment of the applicable fees for Subscription Services as set forth in
an Order Form, MariaDB grants to Customer a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
and revocable license, without the right to sublicense, to use MaxScale for Customer’s internal business
purposes and to use the Documentation in support of Customer’s use of MaxScale.

2. License Restrictions. Customer’s use of MaxScale is limited solely to the use of MaxScale in combination
with Software for which Customer has obtained Subscription Services directly from MariaDB or indirectly from a
Partner.

Customer has no right, and agrees not to:

(a) transfer, assign, resell, distribute, redistribute, rent, lease, lend or sublicense its license rights under these
Terms to any other person or entity or use MaxScale with any copies of MariaDB products or services or Server
for which Customer has not obtained Subscription Services from MariaDB, and Customer acknowledges that
any attempted transfer, assignment, resell, distribution, redistribution, rent, lease, lend, sublicense or use will be
void,

(b) use MaxScale in breach or excess of any limitations (e.g., quantities) prescribed by or agreed with MariaDB,

(c) use or permit MaxScale to be used to perform services for third parties, whether on a service bureau or time-
sharing basis, by way of managed services, commercial hosting services or similar environment, or otherwise,
without the express written authorization of MariaDB,

(d) remove, conceal, or alter any MaxScale identification, proprietary, copyright, intellectual property, or other
notices in MaxScale and Documentation,

(e) copy, decrypt, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, reduce to human-readable form, derive, or attempt
to derive the source code of, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in MaxScale, or any updates or any
part thereof, except to the extent expressly required by applicable law,

(f) modify, adapt, or create a derivative work of MaxScale, or any updates or any part thereof,

(g) use MaxScale after the expiration of the applicable Term, or

(h) assist or encourage any third party to do any of the foregoing.

3. Proprietary Rights. MariaDB owns all worldwide right, title and interest in MaxScale and Documentation
including all related copyright, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, know-how, moral rights, and all
other proprietary rights, including registrations, applications, renewals and extensions of such rights existing
anywhere in the world, whether registered or unregistered.

MaxScale is a trade secret of MariaDB and constitutes MariaDB Confidential Information.

Except for the rights explicitly granted, all rights, title, and interest in MaxScale and Documentation are reserved
and retained by MariaDB.

Customer does not acquire any intellectual property or other rights in MaxScale or Documentation as a result of
using MaxScale or Documentation except as specified in these Terms.

4. Proprietary Notices. Customer agrees to maintain and reproduce all copyright, proprietary, and other notices
on all copies, in any form, of MaxScale in the same form and manner that such copyright and other proprietary
notices are included on MaxScale.

5. Usage certification and audit. MariaDB may require Customer, not more than once per year, that Customer
certifies to MariaDB in writing as to Customer’s then current use of MaxScale, and MariaDB reserves the right to
conduct reasonable audits, with notice, and in a manner that will not materially disrupt Customer’s business.

6. Unauthorized Use. Use of MaxScale outside of the scope of these Terms constitutes a material breach, and
Customer agrees to promptly pay upon notice any applicable additional fees.

7. Benchmarking. Customer may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a
“Benchmark”) of MaxScale. However, Customer must obtain MariaDB’s prior written approval to disclose to a
third party the results of any Benchmark of MaxScale.

8. Term and Termination. These Terms will remain effective during the entire Term applicable to MaxScale.
Upon termination or expiration of such Term, Customer has no rights to continue using MaxScale or
Documentation. All limitations of liability and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty will survive termination of
these Terms.

9. Miscellaneous. If any portion of these Terms is found to be void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of
these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except as expressly provided herein, these Terms, together with
the Subscription Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the license of
MaxScale and Documentation.
